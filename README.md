## What is all about?

Some time ago i watched Travis Nielson Design+Code on Dev Tips youtube channel. On hour 4.1 Travis show how he build setup for his project using Gulp. That was very inspiring and i thought i should try build my own Gulp task wich i could use in my projects.
This is my first expirience with Gulp tasks, dependencies and so on. I'm sure that this setup needs some improvements, and i'll do my best to make it better.

## What can i do with this repo?
Well, i made it for my needs.
Most of all I'm using jade and sass for fast and simple page building and compile them into html/css files.
With this build Gulp do it for me. On Source folder you'll find my project files structure. 
It's based on Travis Nielson idea how to make it clean and easy to read and work with code. 
All outputs are store in Build folder where you can find files ready to send to server. 
Moreover, it opens firefox and refresh the page in the browser every time when Gulp notice changes in your code, allowing you to keep observe your work effects.

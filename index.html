<p>Some time ago i watched Travis Nielson Design+Code on Dev Tips youtube channel. On hour 4.1 Travis show how he build setup for his project using Gulp. That was very inspiring and i thought i should try build my own Gulp task wich i could use in my projects. </p>

<p>This is my first expirience with Gulp tasks, dependencies and so on. I'm sure that this setup needs some improvements, and i'll do my best to make it better.</p>

<p>Well, i made it for my needs. Most of all I'm using jade and sass for fast and simple page building and compile them into html/css files. With this build Gulp do it for me. On <strong>Source folder</strong> you'll find my project files structure. It's based on Travis Nielson idea how to make it clean and easy to read and work with code. All outputs are store in <strong>Build folder</strong> where you can find files ready to send to server. 
Moreover, it refresh the page in the browser allowing you to keep observe your work effects.</p>
